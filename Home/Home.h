//Strong references are used for properties that are primary responsibility of the class, in other words owned by the class.  In this case, Bed rooms are owned by the Home class.

/*Weak references are used for the properties that are the primary responsiblity of some other class.
 
 There are two times, you should use weak
 1) When the property is delegate
 2) When the property is the subview of the main view - this is to avoid memory cycles
